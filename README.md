# neural-network-py

A simple implementation of a neural network built from scratch using only NumPy. This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of neural networks without relying on deep learning frameworks.
Overview
This project creates a neural network capable of binary classification, demonstrated through a gender prediction task based on weight and height inputs. The implementation includes:

Basic neuron implementation
Feedforward neural network with configurable layers
Sigmoid activation function
Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function
Backpropagation for gradient calculation
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization
